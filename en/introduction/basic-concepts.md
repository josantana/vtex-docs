# Basic Concepts

### Storefront

Storefront is the new development kit for VTEX stores and apps.

It brings a whole new perspective for developers in our platform, with new features and improvements such as: complete documentation with best practices for developing single page applications, optimized loading of files, integration with VTEX APIs and a new front-end framework based in React.

VTEX Storefront is still in alpha, but once it goes into production it will replace most features in VTEX's current Portal module.

### Apps

To start working with the new Storefront, it's essential to understand the Apps-based philosophy behind VTEX's new architecture. An App is an application or system that adds a certain functionality to a VTEX store. In fact, the store's layout itself is a theme App that's running on top of it.

Apps bring more autonomy to store operators, allowing them to install new functionality and change the store's layout without depending on developers: App installation on the new Storefront is completely plug & play, with minimal configuration.

On the other hand, developing and publishing Apps will allow agencies and independent developers to diversify their product and service portfolio with an uncomplicated billing system (coming soon!).

Apps can bring different kinds of functionalities to a store: a review App might allow a client to write and reviews, while a theme App allow the store operator to change the whole store layout in a single install.

### Gallery

VTEX Gallery allows developers and agencies to publish their apps — free or paid — that can then be easily found and installed by VTEX store operators.

Apps available in the Gallery are more powerful than the deprecated extensions that used to be avaliable in the VTEX Store, as they offer functionality that can interact with all of VTEX's APIs.

### Editor

Storefront Editor is a default App available for store operators that adds an editing interface on top of the store.

The store operator can use the editor to access their site in Editor Mode and configure components — be it a text on a static page of the site, a banner image, the amount of products a shelf diplays or some layout option on the theme.

Because of the Storefront's modular nature, the Editor Mode for two stores can be completely different, depending on the Apps installed and configuration on each one of them.

### Toolbelt

Toolbelt is a command-line tool created to improve the development and publishing process for Storefront Apps.

Using the Toolbelt it's possible to run a `watch` command on your project folder and see all changes in the browser in real time. Besides, it also offers a `publish` command to push your App to the Gallery once you're ready.
